            To combat our challenge of preparing an exhibit to announce and
            glorify the 7 cancer hospitals, we created a wall of glory. This
            wall showcased the geography of the newly inaugurated hospitals and
            the ones yet to be inaugurated.

            We created colourful standees that were informative and attractive.
