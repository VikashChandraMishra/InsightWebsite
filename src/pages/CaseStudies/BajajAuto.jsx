            In today's competitive market, it is crucial to maximize return on
            investment (ROI), even with small dealer-level budgets. Proper
            audience segmentation is necessary when dealing with more than one
            dealer in the same location. Digital sales tracking is an essential
            tool for measuring performance and identifying areas for
            improvement. However, irregularity in customer data management and
            the absence of a proper customer relationship management (CRM)
            system can hinder a company's ability to leverage customer data
            effectively. Addressing these issues can help businesses stay ahead
            of the competition and achieve their goals.

            To effectively market their latest vehicles and offers, a company
            implemented several strategies. Targeted posts were created to
            showcase the features and specifications of the vehicles, with a
            focus on best-sellers. Geo-specific and targeted ad campaigns were
            launched to generate leads and convert them into sales. A proper
            customer relationship management (CRM) system was implemented to
            manage real-time customer leads and data. Cross-device targeting was
            also utilized to reach a wider audience. In addition, the company
            integrated their Facebook CRM to streamline their customer data
            management process. By utilizing these strategies, the company was
            able to effectively market their vehicles and boost sales.
