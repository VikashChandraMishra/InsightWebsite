            To ensure the success of their rafting campaign, a 3-member team was
            deployed to work closely with the rafting team. In addition, a
            separate on-ground local support team was stationed at various key
            locations to facilitate the capture of high-impact and action-packed
            visuals. Throughout the project, there was constant coordination
            between the on-ground team and the backend team, which was
            responsible for shortlisting and finalizing visuals before
            disseminating them to the public. To maintain an organised and
            comprehensive approach, the backend team also kept detailed logs of
            all content released. Ultimately, the campaign was a resounding
            success, with more than 7 videos on different topics and themes
            released to the public.
