          <Typography variant="p">
            Initiated by the Directorate of Agriculture, a drive was conducted
            for 45 days to raise awareness and to tackle the lack of awareness,
            impart information about schemes and benefits to the farmers. 20
            vehicles were installed with large-sized LED screens that moved
            across all 33 districts of the State. The LED vans displayed
            audio-visuals based on the demographic and linguistic patterns of
            the region in Assam on different kinds of farming techniques and
            mechanisms along with showcasing various schemes, technological
            inventions, upliftment, and introduction of machinery to boost
            agricultural sector of Assam.

            Notable schemes included the National Food Security Mission 2020-21,
            Soil Health Card Programme, PMFBY (Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima
            Yojana), and Targeting Rice Fallow Areas TRFA (Pulse) 2019-20. The
            entire roster of District Agriculture Officers was involved in the
            process, coordinating with the Vehicle (Van) Driver and support
            staff on the daily basis and guiding them as to where to target the
            procedure for maximum impact and reach. Daily reports were shared by
            the Driver and support staff along with photos that were timestamped
            and location stamped.

            The entire rural drive under D.O.A was a huge success. The activity
            helped increase awareness and knowledge of the farmers in different
            aspects such as the use of machinery, and agricultural techniques
            along with a profound understanding of the schemes and benefits
            provided to farmers overall.

            In 45 days of the initiative, the activity reached out to more than
            80% of the farming population of rural Assam (27.2 lakh farmers)
            inclusive of households small & large, making them aware of the
            facets mentioned above.
